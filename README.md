This repository contains a Java program that exhibits an unusual error related to exception handling within a loop. The primary issue is that while an ArithmeticException is caught, the program does not gracefully handle the error and the loop continues to execute, possibly leading to unexpected behavior or further errors. The solution demonstrates a proper way to handle this type of situation.
